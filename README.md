# Hand Tracking Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The goal is to detect and track hand movements in real-time via a webcam. The project uses MediaPipe's hand tracking model, which provides the landmarks of the hand, allowing for detailed analysis and interaction.

## Features

* **Hand Landmark Detection**: Tracks key landmarks of the hand and visualizes them.
* **Multi-hand Support**: Detects and tracks up to two hands simultaneously.
* **Real-time Hand Tracking**: Works with live webcam feed for real-time tracking.

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handtracking-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd handtracking-project
```

3. Install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

1. Connect a webcam to your system.
2. Run the Python script `handtracking.py`:

```bash
python handtracking.py
```

3. The script will open a webcam feed, where you will see your hand(s) tracked and marked with key landmarks. Press **'q'** to exit the program.

## Notes

* This project uses **MediaPipe**'s Hand model for hand tracking and **OpenCV** for capturing the webcam feed.
* You can customize this script to add more features, such as gesture recognition or hand motion control.
